# SLSC-EDS-Plugin-Custom-Device
SLSC EDS (Electronic Datasheet) Plugin Custom Device allows any generic SLSC Capabilities File to be used within the VeriStand.

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2017

### Built Availability ###

Builds of this IP are available on request through NI field sales.

### Quality, Limitations ###

Preview

Only user "admin" with empty password access is supported at the moment due to a limitation from the chassis custom device.

### Developer Documentation ###

#### Design Decisions ####
- always use NVMEMcap.bin file and custom parser to extract all information from module. This reduces effort for maintaining the option of importing automatically from a connected module as well as an offline configuration.
- Not showing string properties since it is unknown how they would be used in VeriStand.
